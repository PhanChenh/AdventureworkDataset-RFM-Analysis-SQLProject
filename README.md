# Projcet Title: RFM Analysis Using SQL on the AdventureWorks Dataset

## Project Overview: 

Dataset: AdventureWorks2022.bak 

RFM analysis is a basic model for customer segmentation or customer segmentation based on customer buying behavior. By doing this, you gain insights into which customers are the most valuable to your business, how recently they interacted with your business, how often they make purchases, and how much they spend.

## Objectives:

## Project Structure:
1. Identify Customer Segments:
- Recency (R): How recently did the customer make a purchase? Customers who 
bought recently are more likely to buy again.
- Frequency (F): How often does the customer make a purchase? Frequent buyers are often more loyal and engaged.
- Monetary (M): How much money does the customer spend? High spenders are more profitable.

2. Focus on the Right Marketing Tactics:
By analyzing each segmentâ€™s behavior, you can direct marketing efforts where 
they will be most effective.
